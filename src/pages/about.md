I'm Dan. A front-end developer and all round creative living in the UK. I spend most of my paid time building web apps with React and TypeScript. When
I'm on my own dime I like to dig in to stuff I'm unlikely to get into for
work. This site is built with Astro for example.

I'll be back to write more about me soon but I'm busy building this site right now.
