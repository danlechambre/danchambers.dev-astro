I recently made the decision to move on from my current job in search of pastures new. There's quite a bit of thought goes into a decision like this, but ultimately you leave a job when you boxes not being ticked.

So it's got me thinking about everything that makes a job, and what my _ideal_ job would look like.

In no particular order, here goes:

- **Work to my strengths** - I'm a front-end engineer. That's the end I want to work with. There are other folk for other ends.
- **Variety** - I'm not saying I get bored easy but 6-12 months is about the right project length to hold my interest.
- **Make an impact** - I want the work I do have a meaningful, positive impact on a tiny portion of the world.
- **Work anywhere** - I need only a laptop and minimal distractions to do my work. I should be free to do this from wherever I choose.
- **Work anytime** - so long as I turn up to meetings when expected, shaping the rest of my week should be up to me. If I want an extra long breakfast, or to work during the witching hour, where's the harm?
- **Give me a Mac** - or let me use mine. I'm most productive with the tools I'm familiar with.
