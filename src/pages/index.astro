    <p>I'm a front-end developer and all-round creative based in the UK.</p>
    <p>
      I love what I do. I love that I get better at it every day. I love that
      peeps give me money to do it (I even do it for free ðŸ¤«). I love that it
      nearly gets me to the end of level baddie in Maslow's Pyramid.

      Day-to-day, building with React and TypeScript is what keeps the cash
      money flowing. When I'm not on the clock, I'll build with whatever takes
      my fancy (code or otherwise). Right now, that's mostly <a
        href="https://threejs.org/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js</a
      > and plywood (as in the actual wood, not this <a
        href="https://plywood.imply.io/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">JS library</a
      > - who knew!).

      Welcome to my site. It's built with <a
        href="https://astro.build"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a
      >. I take a digital gardening approach to its design and maintenance. Like
      my actual garden, I don't get as much time to spend on it as I'd like and
      some bits may go to wrack and ruin whilst I'm putting in a new birdbath.
      Like my actual garden, people are welcome to visit and enjoy it, but it's
      mostly for me - if I want to put a hideous gnome in the flower bed - then
      I will.
